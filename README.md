**This is the GitHub repository for the WFO General Curatorial Team**

We **will** use this to manage general curatorial suggestions and decisions. 

If you want to suggest a publication that contains classification you think we should consider please use the literture issue or if you have a specific taxonomic proposal, please use that. Do fill in the forms as much as possible it will help in the decision making. 

Taxonomic changes should be based on published works. Changes will be discusse, voted on and if approved then integrated into Rhakhis.

[Suggest literature or propose a taxonomic change here.](https://github.com/worldflora/wfo-general-curatorial-team/issues/new/choose)
